Making of this Project---

 Step 1:
 Project Setup
    frontend + Backend

✅ What You Have Now

A working backend server (Node + Express)
A frontend homepage (HTML, CSS, JS)
Clean structure ready for development

Step 2:
 Building the post creation and display feature
 We’ll start with a frontend-only implementation — you’ll be able to:
✅ Open a post creation form
✅ Write a title + message
✅ See it instantly appear on the feed
✅ Keep styling consistent and modern

Later, we’ll connect it to your backend + database (MongoDB or MySQL)
